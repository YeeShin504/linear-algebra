/*
[mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
is a popular theme for MkDocs that is compatible with this plugin.
But, in its css, it limits the `max-width` of the content area to be 61rem.
This appears to be just small enough that the JupyterLite notebook, when embedded,
thinks it is on a mobile device, and so many of the important UI elements of JupyterLite,
such as the "add cell below" hover menu, are hidden.

To get around this (as demonstrated in this repo):
- add a `extra.css` file in your docs directory with the following content (as in this file):
  ```css
  .md-main__inner.md-grid {
    max-width: 70rem;
  }
  ```
- Then add this to your `mkdocs.yml`:
  ```yaml
  extra_css:
    - extra.css
  ```

I have set this up in this repository as an example if that is confusing.

If you can think of a better/automatic way to do this, please file an issue.
